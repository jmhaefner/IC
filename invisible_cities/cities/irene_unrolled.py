From ancient Greek, Εἰρήνη: Peace.

This city finds the signal pulses within the waveforms produced by the
detector or by diomira in the case of Monte Carlo data.
This includes a number of tasks:
    - Remove the signal-derivative effect of the PMT waveforms.
    - Calibrate PMTs and produced a PMT-summed waveform.
    - Remove the baseline from the SiPM waveforms and calibrate them.
    - Apply a threshold to the PMT-summed waveform.
    - Find pulses in the PMT-summed waveform.
    - Match the time window of the PMT pulse with those in the SiPMs.
    - Build the PMap object.
